# CREATIVE PHASE: ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

## PROJECT: Jenkins + Wiz CLI Integration
**Date**: 2025-07-20 13:10
**Phase**: Architecture Design

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design the architecture for integrating Wiz CLI security scanning into a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, ensuring seamless automation, proper error handling, and clear reporting of security findings.

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Simple Pipeline Integration
**Description**: Basic integration where Wiz CLI runs as a single pipeline stage
**Pros**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Minimal changes to existing pipeline
- Quick to get started
**Cons**:
- Limited error handling and recovery
- No detailed reporting integration
- May block pipeline on any security issue
**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: 2-3 hours

### Option 2: Comprehensive Security Pipeline
**Description**: Multi-stage security pipeline with detailed reporting, parallel scanning, and configurable failure thresholds
**Pros**:
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Detailed security reporting in Jenkins
- Configurable security policies
- Parallel scanning for multiple components
**Cons**:
- More complex to implement and maintain
- Requires more Jenkins configuration
- Higher resource usage
**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: 8-12 hours

### Option 3: Hybrid Security Integration
**Description**: Balanced approach with core security scanning and optional detailed reporting, with configurable failure modes
**Pros**:
- Good balance of simplicity and functionality
- Configurable security policies
- Integrated reporting without over-complexity
- Scalable for future enhancements
**Cons**:
- Moderate complexity
- Requires careful configuration
**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: 4-6 hours

## DECISION
**Selected Approach**: Option 3 - Hybrid Security Integration

**Rationale**: 
- Provides the right balance of functionality and maintainability
- Allows for future enhancements while keeping initial implementation manageable
- Supports both basic and advanced security scanning needs
- Fits well with the demonstration nature of this project

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Pipeline Integration
1. Create Jenkins pipeline with security stage
2. Implement Wiz CLI integration script
3. Add basic error handling and reporting

### Phase 2: Enhanced Reporting
1. Integrate security results into Jenkins interface
2. Add configurable failure thresholds
3. Implement detailed security reporting

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add parallel scanning capabilities
2. Implement security policy configuration
3. Add notification and alerting features
