## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design the user interface and experience for the Jenkins pipeline integration, including how security results are displayed, configured, and interacted with by developers and DevOps teams.

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Basic Jenkins Integration
**Description**: Simple integration using Jenkins' built-in reporting and console output
**Pros**:
- Minimal development effort
- Uses existing Jenkins UI
- Familiar to Jenkins users
**Cons**:
- Limited visual appeal
- Basic information display
- No interactive features
**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: 1-2 hours

### Option 2: Advanced Jenkins Plugin
**Description**: Custom Jenkins plugin with rich UI, interactive dashboards, and detailed security reporting
**Pros**:
- Rich user experience
- Interactive dashboards
- Detailed security visualizations
- Customizable views
**Cons**:
- Complex development
- Requires plugin development skills
- Longer implementation time
**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: 10-15 hours

### Option 3: Enhanced Jenkins Integration
**Description**: Enhanced integration using Jenkins' built-in features plus custom HTML reports and dashboards
**Pros**:
- Good user experience without plugin complexity
- Custom HTML reports for rich visualization
- Uses Jenkins' existing infrastructure
- Reasonable development effort
**Cons**:
- Limited to HTML report capabilities
- Some features require external tools
**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: 4-6 hours

## DECISION
**Selected Approach**: Option 3 - Enhanced Jenkins Integration

**Rationale**: 
- Provides good user experience without the complexity of plugin development

2. Add security status indicators to pipeline stages
3. Create basic HTML report templates

### Phase 2: Enhanced Reporting
1. Implement detailed HTML security reports
2. Add security metrics and trend visualization
3. Create configurable report templates

### Phase 3: Advanced UI Features
1. Add interactive security dashboards
2. Implement security policy configuration UI
3. Add notification and alerting interfaces
