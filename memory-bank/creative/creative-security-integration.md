# CREATIVE PHASE: SECURITY INTEGRATION DESIGN

## PROJECT: Jenkins + Wiz CLI Integration
**Date**: 2025-07-20 13:12
**Phase**: Security Integration Design

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design the security integration patterns and workflow for Wiz CLI integration, including authentication, scan execution, result processing, and security policy enforcement.

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Basic Token Authentication
**Description**: Simple environment variable-based authentication with direct Wiz CLI execution
**Pros**:
- Simple to implement
- Standard approach for CLI tools
- Easy to configure in Jenkins
**Cons**:
- Limited security features
- No token rotation or management
- Basic error handling only
**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: 1-2 hours

### Option 2: Advanced Security Integration
**Description**: Comprehensive security integration with token management, scan policies, and detailed result analysis
**Pros**:
- Robust security features
- Configurable scan policies
- Detailed vulnerability analysis
- Advanced error handling
**Cons**:
- Complex implementation
- Requires more configuration
- Higher maintenance overhead
**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: 6-8 hours

### Option 3: Balanced Security Integration
**Description**: Enhanced security integration with policy-based scanning, result categorization, and configurable thresholds
**Pros**:
- Good security features without over-complexity
- Policy-based scanning
- Result categorization and filtering
- Configurable failure thresholds
**Cons**:
- Moderate complexity
- Requires policy configuration
**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: 3-4 hours

## DECISION
**Selected Approach**: Option 3 - Balanced Security Integration

**Rationale**: 
- Provides essential security features without unnecessary complexity
- Supports policy-based scanning for different project types
- Allows for result categorization and filtering
- Maintains reasonable implementation time while providing good functionality

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Security Integration
1. Implement Wiz CLI authentication with token management
2. Create basic scan execution with error handling
3. Add result parsing and categorization

### Phase 2: Policy-Based Scanning
1. Implement configurable scan policies
2. Add severity-based filtering
3. Create threshold-based failure conditions

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add scan result caching and comparison
2. Implement trend analysis
3. Add security metrics and reporting

## SECURITY COMPONENTS
- **Authentication Manager**: Handles Wiz CLI token management
- **Policy Engine**: Manages scan policies and configurations
- **Scan Executor**: Runs Wiz CLI scans with proper error handling
- **Result Processor**: Parses and categorizes security findings
- **Threshold Manager**: Enforces security policy thresholds
- **Report Generator**: Creates security reports for Jenkins
