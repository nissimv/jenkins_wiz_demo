# CREATIVE PHASE: DATA FLOW DESIGN

## PROJECT: Jenkins + Wiz CLI Integration
**Date**: 2025-07-20 13:14
**Phase**: Data Flow Design

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design the data flow patterns for security scan results processing, including how data moves between components, how it's stored, transformed, and reported throughout the Jenkins pipeline.

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Simple Data Flow
**Description**: Basic data flow with direct Wiz CLI output processing and simple result storage
**Pros**:
- Simple to implement
- Minimal data transformation
- Easy to debug and maintain
**Cons**:
- Limited data analysis capabilities
- No historical data tracking
- Basic reporting only
**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: 1-2 hours

### Option 2: Advanced Data Pipeline
**Description**: Complex data pipeline with ETL processes, data warehousing, and advanced analytics
**Pros**:
- Comprehensive data analysis
- Historical trend analysis
- Advanced reporting capabilities
- Data persistence and backup
**Cons**:
- Complex implementation
- Requires additional infrastructure
- Higher maintenance overhead
**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: 8-12 hours

### Option 3: Structured Data Flow
**Description**: Well-structured data flow with proper data transformation, storage, and analysis capabilities
**Pros**:
- Good data organization and structure
- Historical data tracking
- Configurable data processing
- Reasonable complexity
**Cons**:
- Requires careful data design
- Moderate implementation effort
**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: 3-4 hours

## DECISION
**Selected Approach**: Option 3 - Structured Data Flow

**Rationale**: 
- Provides good data organization without over-complexity
- Supports historical data tracking for trend analysis
- Allows for configurable data processing and reporting
- Maintains reasonable implementation time while providing good functionality

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Data Flow
1. Design data structures for security scan results
2. Implement data parsing and transformation
3. Create basic data storage and retrieval

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data Processing
1. Add data validation and error handling
2. Implement data aggregation and summarization
3. Create data export and reporting capabilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Data Features
1. Add historical data tracking and trends
2. Implement data comparison and analysis
3. Create data visualization and dashboards

## DATA COMPONENTS
- **Data Parser**: Processes raw Wiz CLI output into structured data
- **Data Validator**: Ensures data quality and completeness
- **Data Storage**: Manages security scan result storage and retrieval
- **Data Aggregator**: Combines and summarizes security data
- **Report Generator**: Creates formatted reports for Jenkins UI
- **Data Exporter**: Handles data export for external analysis
