# SYSTEM PATTERNS

## Security-First CI/CD Pattern
- Scan Early: Security scanning integrated in early pipeline stages
- Fail Fast: Build fails on critical security issues
- Token Management: Secure handling of Wiz CLI authentication tokens
- Automated Reporting: Security scan results integrated into pipeline output

## Testing Patterns
- Unit Testing: Basic pytest implementation for code validation
- Security Testing: Wiz CLI scanning for vulnerability detection
- Pipeline Testing: End-to-end CI/CD validation

## File Organization
`
project/
 wiz_scan.sh          # Security scanning script
 test_app.py          # Application code
 requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
 README.md            # Project documentation
`

## CI/CD Integration Pattern
1. Code Commit: Developer pushes code changes
2. Build Trigger: Jenkins pipeline triggered
3. Dependency Install: Install Python dependencies
4. Unit Tests: Run pytest validation
5. Security Scan: Execute Wiz CLI scanning
6. Results Analysis: Evaluate security findings
7. Deployment Decision: Proceed or fail based on results

## Security Token Pattern
- Environment variable injection: WIZ_TOKEN
- Secure credential management in Jenkins
- Runtime token validation before scanning
